I'm so pleased to annouce the very first Rails Girls event in Japan is about to happen.
The event will be held on 7-8th September, 2012 at COOKPAD, Tokyo.
At this moment, Rails Girls Tokyo team is working hard to origanize the event.
But, why in Tokyo?
<br/>
<br/>
The idea came upon when I learned Linda and Terence, who are core member of Rails Girls,
would make a presentation about Rails Girls at Sapporo RubyKaigi. Soon, I contected them to
have Rails Girls event along with their presentation. At first, I planned to have the event in
Sapporo, where this year's RubyKaigi will be held. I've talked with some of Sapporo RubyKaigi
origanizers for weeks. Unfortunately, I ended up in throwing Rails Girls Sapporo away.
I couldn't find good days for the event such that many attendees and volunteers would show up.
That was a sad decision since I've lost a chance to show Rails Girls event in Japan to Linda
and Terence. However, I took the option that Rails Girls event would happen actually.

<br/>
I moved the place to Tokyo. Origanizing an event in Tokyo is very easy compared to the one in Sapporo.
Many Rubyists and Rails developers are in Tokyo, while not many in Sapporo. Besides, Rubyists in Sapporo
are all super busy for RubyKaigi. Choosing a place is also easy in Tokyo since
there are many possible places to have the Rails Girls event.
Among them, I chose COOKPAD. COOKPAD was a diamond sponcer at RailsConf 2012 and
orignizes meetups for Rubyists regularly. I've talked with some COOKPAD develepers in person.
When Kakutani-san, a Rails Girls Tokyo organizer, contacted COOKPAD, they immediately said OK to use a room.
Of course, it's free with free internet connection.
I'm so grateful about thier geneous manner over Rails Girls event.

Now, I've gotten date, room and team members and am working hard to make Rails Girls event happen in Tokyo.
Look at us, Rails Girls Tokyo team, how the first event will go.
